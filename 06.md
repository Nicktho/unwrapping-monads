# What makes a Monad a Monad

*bind* follows:

m a *->* (a *->* m b) *->* m b

It's *first* argument is a *monad* that wraps a value *a*

The *second* is a *lambda* that takes the value *a* as an argument
and returns a *monad* that wraps a new value, *b*.

This *lambda* is passed in by the consumer of the monad, as a way
to transform the values. The *lambda* is what makes monads a great
method of control flow for async operations!
