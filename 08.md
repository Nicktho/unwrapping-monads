# What makes a Monad a Monad

The first *axiom* is as follows:

```javascript

  bind(unit(a), f) === f(a)

```

Let's break this down.

*f* is our *lambda*, when we pass in a value, *a*, it must return the
same value as if we passed in our monad that wraps *a* to our *bind* function,
along with the same *lambda*, *f*.

This axiom insures that *bind* unwraps our monad, as passes the value
as is to our *lambda*, the same as if we passed the raw value to
our *lambda*.

We can test out this *axiom* with some *node*

```javascript

  const a = 'test' 
  const monad = unit(a)

  const test = unwrappedVal => { // our `f`
    assert(unwrappedVal, a) // bind unwrapped correctly.

    return unit(unwrappedVal) // return a new monad
  }

  const newMonad = bind(monad, test)

  assert(newMonad, test(a)) // bind should return what our lamba returns.

```
