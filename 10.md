# What makes a Monad a Monad

The third *axiom* ensures we can compose our binds.

```javascript

  bind(bind(monad, f), g) === bind(monad, a => bind(f(a), g))

```

Let's break this down:

We can pass the result of a *bind* as the monad to another *bind*

The second bind's *lambda*, in this case *g*, will recieve the unwrapped
value of the result of the bind's *lambda*.

```javascript

  const monad = unit(1)

  const firstResult = bind(monad, a => unit(a + 1))

  const secondResult = bind(firstResult, a => unit(a * 2))

  bind(secondResult, a => assert(a, 4))

```
